Objective:</br>
Mobile friendly browser calculator

Next Objectives:</br>
* Handle long numbers
    * ID largest reasonable number
    * ID what to do when that limit is reached
* Make DEL functional
* Make '.' functional
* ~~Make equals do the last operation and value entered~~
* Make every operator press but the first equals() and display() until AC
* Make posNeg equals() when pressed

Takeaways:</br>
* I decided to give non operators (AC, DEL, =, ...) listeners by ID because they are not arithmetic operators, and stored.makeArg depends on the last operator key press
